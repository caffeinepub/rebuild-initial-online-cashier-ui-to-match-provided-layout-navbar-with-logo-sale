# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the low-stock reminder visuals easier on the eyes by using a lighter, brighter background color for low-stock warning surfaces while keeping text/icons readable in light and dark mode.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the low-stock theme tokens/colors used by the Dashboard low-stock reminder banner background to a lighter/brighter shade.
- Update the low-stock highlighted table-row background styling (Dashboard inventory table and low-stock banner table rows) to use the same updated lighter/brighter background consistently.
- Verify/adjust foreground (text/icon) contrast against the updated background in both light mode and dark mode without changing copy or layout.

**User-visible outcome:** On the Dashboard, the low-stock reminder banner and low-stock highlighted rows appear visibly lighter/brighter than before, while remaining readable in both light and dark mode.
