        "Navigating to Reports → Inventory Report renders the Inventory Report page and attempts to fetch data using the existing anonymous actor flow (no Internet Identity sign-in prompt is shown).",
        "If there are no report entries, the page shows the existing empty state message rather than an authentication error.",
        "If the backend is temporarily unavailable, the page shows the existing connection error UI with a working Retry that re-attempts the query."

          "description": "Update InventoryReportPage to avoid presenting any authentication-required error state: detect when the thrown error normalizes to an auth/unauthorized classification and override the displayed error title/message to a non-auth (e.g., generic/connection-style) message while keeping the existing Retry behavior (refetch) intact. Keep the existing empty state when data is an empty list. Use existing shadcn-ui composed components already in the file (Card/Table) to maintain consistent UI; verify the component's usage instructions before implementing."
