  "summary": "ProductFormModal was updated to derive Product Name dropdown options from backend products (via useProducts) and to memoize/sort unique names. Due to truncation, the implementation details for loading/error UI handling and dropdown scroll constraints cannot be fully verified from the provided snippet, though the diff summary text claims they exist. Unrequested updates were made to project_state.json tracking metadata.",
